# Soan

Soan is an HTTP-like client/server framework based upon zeromq and msgpack designed for building internal services.  The goal is to build a system that leverages our knowledge of building RESTful services (and the benefits we get for designing services this was) but provides a more-resilient, more-performant, and more scalable framework out of the box than building your own homegrown HTTP-based system.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'soan'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install soan
